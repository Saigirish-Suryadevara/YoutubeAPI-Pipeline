Ugw00JZ5HUTMz2WnwyF4AaABAg,@thomashodis5740,"It&#39;s a badass looking phone. BUT what about us big handed guys with fat fingers? I use to only use the note series from Samsung. But after they started charging the price of a car for a cell phone I grew up and realized that while yes having the newest and coolest phone was fun it wasn&#39;t economical anymore. When I was younger and didn&#39;t have a wife and family a $1k + dollar phone was fine but after having children and growing up I decided to look at other brands. Well wouldn&#39;t you know the alcatel A3 does everything to a T , that my samsung did except the S-pen. Now don&#39;t get me wrong those phones are a thing of beauty but when I walk into a store like metro and see that I can get the phone that does everything I could want it to do and I can walk out with the phone for 50 dollars plus tax and I&#39;ve been beating on this thing for over a year without it giving up on me I have to sincerely apologize for not making the change sooner and saving myself thousands over the years. I own every note except the 10. And I can honestly say if I don&#39;t get one for under 300 I won&#39;t be getting one. I can justify 300 for a smart phone. Sorry if I&#39;m a 30 something prude, it&#39;s not a lack of funds it&#39;s a wealth of knowledge from spending thousands over the years thinking I absolutely had to have that newest , best phone. Once you get a phone that fits you and does a really good reliable job of service. You learn to appreciate the more affordable things in life lol. Keep them new vids coming!",0

Some of the completely unexpected brands sell better smartphones than some of the greats of the future.",0

The thing is, 🍎&#39;s, Samsung&#39;s and now Huawei&#39;s reputations are way to big to be tarnish by this idea, despite how huge and how impressing it is. Sadly, at the end of the day, people want their phone to be from a recongizable brand, especially when you&#39;re from places where people won&#39;t give you the credit you deserve for buying such a phone as this. If it were only as diverse with tech as, for example, LG, then I&#39;d be quick to get it; but it&#39;s not so... 🤷🏾‍♂😅😆.

Ugwl62R8P4oCvGSl65J4AaABAg,@JA-vr1jm,"Just bought the oppo a73, and for a $230au (approx $180us) its a brilliant phone. Imo the only letdowns are the mono speaker that is loud but distorts 2-3 notches from full (the supplied earbuds sound really good which makes up for it) and i prefer the vol and power buttons on opposite sides. Two pros are the comfort of the fp scanner on the back rather than front, and the screen size/ clarity.<br>Was gonna go with a Xaomi Redmi, but a local warranty and Afterpay made it a better option for me, as a budget phone with current specs is enough for me and being one that has never owned anything apple besides a couple of ipods. Although Colour OS is taking some getting used to, ie the bootlegged iPhone OS, if its anything to go by, this model must be top notch.",1

Come on guys you need to step up your games faster. Let me give you  an insight about innovation, &quot;a cover for the phone that has motor inside for your extra gadget&quot;. Think about it, powerful phones getting cheaper and apple is still expensive. You can fight the price game by adding innovation like i said earlier to provide more benefits (innovation) to your consumer at a same price or hell yeah can be lower than that tbh. Dont limit your imagination to be all features in one phone only. Expand it. Bluetooth is dying too, so use it as your connector for the innovation. <br>P/s : anyone wants to hire me ? I have lots of idea. LOL",0

So why does anyone cares about 1-2 mm extra of screen size.<br><br>The phone has improved as much as it can and all these tards are jerking off in unison over a 5% increase in &#39;X&#39; feature and calling it &quot;innovation&quot;. No.<br><br>The iPhone that enabled us to do away with a dialpad or keyboard is an innovation. The drastic improvement in cameras has made the standalone camera useless. The improvements in wireless connectivity, processor and available RAM. Hell, even the Swype keyboard is innovation.<br><br>But a sliver of screen size? Get real.

UgxVZR-Fseh8SkTB44p4AaABAg,@chrisa.4186,"That gesture based thing was done by Nokia at least 8 years ago.  So many companies get their swag from Nokia, but Nokia died because they hired a Microsoft exec and tried to switch to a Windows based platform that the entire world rejected at least 2 to 3 times before.  Yes, it was a brilliant move on Nokia&#39;s part 🙄.  Anyway, now they&#39;re dead when they had the most superior phones on the planet.  Should&#39;ve gone with Android as their platform when they could&#39;ve. They might be on it now, but first impressions are everything, and when they &quot;re-first impressioned&quot; on the scene to try to compete as a 3rd option, ios, android or....windows, and people were, again, like &quot;Nah, bro&quot; the impression was made, and now they&#39;re behind and have no longer have brand equity.  So, they might be great with the android platform, but people aren&#39;t checking for them.  Hiring that Microsoft guy was a great move wasn&#39;t it.  Not that I&#39;m salty that he ruined my favorite brand or anything.  But it&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m with Samsung now.  Note fan 4 life.  Ah needz ma pen.  I neeeedz it!",0

Only had this phone for 2 weeks and I don&#39;t think any other phone so simple will replace it till someone else decides to make a phone this easy to mod haha. oppo looks cool but the quality of the phones build is garbage. i have the same almost the same features as the oppo when it comes to gestures I wish i had a patient haha!  the difference is on 9.0 i modded the feature for the full notch support &quot; this took me 40 hours of non stop to me abuse in development idk who at essential codded it to begin with but shit your way better than me&quot; and i&#39;ve added every app that has/doesn&#39;t have support for the full screen, the best example i can comment about would be the 8.1 option to use the full screen and notch for videos on netfix/youtube.  the latest update for youtube got rid of that and added boarders to all versions somehow maybe a bug on my phones part i&#39;ll have to really look at the code and see but for now I just made it aggressive make every app use the entire screen and hides the border on apps like twitter its so immersive when u can see someones tweet on ur bezzle basically not like im reading the very very top 2cm of my phone but on the astetic side it looks beautiful",0

I prefer this device over the one advertised in this video, why? Mainly because the phone is backed more by the manufacturer Samsung and the software is something I am more used to for the buttons (and I feel as if though the software for the Samsung will have more support too). When I first saw the phone Find X, I was wondering a couple things, first, is it as water resistant as the S9+. Second, what happens if the servo motors in the device fails, how easy is it going to be to get that fixed. I don&#39;t usually have insurance on my phone, because I protect it really well with an Otterbox case and some sort of strong highly rated hardened screen protector. I am usually very good with my electronics also. Hardly ever drop my phones or other digital devices. And can you even add a case to this phone with it doing the cool thing that it does? That would be a deal breaker for me because I always protect my phones and want to know they are safe. Knowing the screen takes up a large percentage of the body doesn&#39;t really entice me over these other factors because I know the phone I have already has a great screen to body ratio / percentage. And the S9+ has a nice screen curvature, but not too much in my opinion.",0

I always thought that Android Phone manufacturers excluding Samsung are manufactured just to get Inspired from Apple phones.... Look at the ugly notch and unnecessary headphone jack removal.<br><br>Iphone X was the worst Apple design in the history. It just could have looked much beautiful if it just had a full head rather than an ugly notch. Considering that Oppo and Vivo atleast had taken some kind of risk. Moving parts can get damaged and makes the phone less dust and waterproof, but atleast give props where it is due. They made a beautiful design which even Apple, which is the biggest industry in the whole world, couldn&#39;t do. They atleast opened the doors for a new era of the smartphone market!<br><br>❤️So, Kudos to Vivo and Oppo❤️",0

You get half a grain of dust in that sliding mechanism and you&#39;re screwed. Sure. It looks cool. It&#39;s a neat party trick. But I&#39;ll keep my galaxy s9 plus. Thanks. Plus, I&#39;ve seen a few other reviews on it, and the picture quality, it&#39;s not actually all that great. Do a side by side with it and the galaxy s9 plus. I promise you will be disappointed. Another flaw. No headphone jack... Being a music buff. Those little air pods or any of the other pod style headphones. They suck. Sound quality and battery life wise. Sure. There are some pretty good bluetooth headphones out there. But they ALL have one major flaw. You have to make sure to plug them all in. In a world where everybody wants wireless charging and the quickest way to do ANYTHING. It&#39;s just too much. Now. Sure. What if you don&#39;t mind the extra cords and work. Okay. That&#39;s cool. But forget to plug them in one night or be in a rush and not have time to wait for them to charge and you&#39;re screwed. Headphone Jack&#39;s should, at the very least, be an emergency backup option. But hey. What do I know...",0

UgxxIQDVw6XoZlCRXPt4AaABAg,@Charlie_12x3,I love OPPO I’ve been using their hifi portable music player for over a year now and I have to say it’s right next to my Astell &amp; Kern so I’m figuring this phone most definitely will have a built in DAC for music lovers. They’re a great company and their customer service is top notch. I’m sorry Apple my iPhone 10 is going into its box when this gets released to the public. This is what I’ve been wanting for a long time a all screen phone and the fact that it’s OPPO just makes it that much more desirable for me since I’m an audiophile and know what the company is capable of manufacturing. All screen with built in dac. The fact that they threw in a 256GB chip tells me that this will be the one phone for audiophiles. 256GB storage allows easy downloads of lossless files that use more storage than typical compressed files we’re used to on smartphones. I’m crossing my fingers and hoping they carry on their tradition on to this phone.,0

UgwaIzBL28-graVQuop4AaABAg,@mudithhimwan2442,i hate this obsession with removing every nanometer of bezel around a smartphone...first of all bezels help you to hold on to the phone while watching videos or playing games...it is already hard enough to hold S9 and S9+ with their infinity displays without accidental touches.....and second of all why dont manufacturers focus on something useful..like increasing the battery size.?? NOOOO because it is not glamorous...they cant make flashy marketing campaigns with it which they can do with giant bezel less displays....Name one flagship smartphone which gives more than 5 hrs screen on time...you can&#39;t...it is embarrassing really,79

Moving parts is not the future (which have a higher fail rate among other things). The future is unobtrusive sensors and cameras hidden under the display which someone already (not mentioning any names but the Find X is blatantly ripping off their flagship) is working on. Innovation is folding a screen at the bottom of the phone so the phone doesn’t have a chin and having even bezels except for a notch at the top which eventually will be phased out when the tech is ready.,0

UgwMSEGV8SRKA4DAaB94AaABAg,@pspvita99,"Phones now days, still cant get the aspect ratios and resolutions right. Half of your screen is going to be cut off/non usuable. Just like movies now days too. How hard is it to use a 16:9 aspect ratio? Also the screen on this phone isn&#39;t that impressive, its still not even 4k. Normal resolutions are 1280x720p,1920x1080p, 2560X1440p, this should technically be called 3k, but 3840x2160p is considered 4k, this should be considered 7k, but its considered 8k 7,680x4,320p;<br>Anyway these are all normal resolutions, 16:9 aspect ratio is really important as well. This phone is a 1080p, 2k hybrid. I guess this is what you sacrifice for a thinner bezel; atleast until we get the battery over heating issues handled, anyway I&#39;m not really impressed. The Razor phone is a good phone if your looking for a normal resolution/if you want to utilize all of the screen relastate your paying for, Or you can go way back to get a better screen, the note 4 has a 2560x1440p screen, or LG has some phones that are from 2013/maybe 2014 that are okay screen wise. The Note line started going down hill after the Note 4. The Note 5 has no removable battery, no upgrade screen wise, technically we haven&#39;t had any updates, screen wise in a long long time. I have a 4k TV now, but my phones not 4k, technically at this point phones should be 8k, since we have 4k tvs now. Back in the day usually you would have a 720p tv at home, and your phone would be 1080p, technically since I have a 4k home tv, and monitors, my phone should be 8k. Anyway phone makers are slacking. Also I relize theres not allot of support for these higher reslitions, except for youtube, but thats also , because no one has 8k phones, and only a few people have 8k minitors, if theres no demand, theres no reason to support the higher better resolutions; all phone makers are doing is holding progression technology wise back.",0

Da Vinci designed the plane and submarine, but people made those things real hundreds years after.

Ugzk0mceYw-GDJv1Af94AaABAg,@obvioustruth,"Full of shit presentation! This phone doesn&#39;t change anything. This is why:<br><br>1. It is chinese (it means produced by company owned by chinese communist secret service). The last thing I would ever like to do is to support company owned by communist. I hoped it was Polish, Hungarian, or at least maybe American or Japanese, but in fact it was a product made by organization strongly tied up to Chinese communist party. No way I am going to buy it.<br><br>2. It has curved screen corners exactly like TVs made by communist eastern block countries in the 80s. This is a retarded idea to produce screens with curved corners. With such screen you can not calculate resolution by multiplying pixesl in horizontal line by pixels in vertical line because many these lines differ in length due curvature of the corners. If someone gives you such resolution keep in mind that at least hundreds of such pixels are not displayed (they are basically removed from screen).<br><br>I bought Samsung Galaxy S8 &gt;year ago, when it was the latest model and I regret it because of pt. 2. and its curved edge display shitty technology and I totally forgot about these facts when I ordered my Samsung S8. Someone is going to make screen that looks like a circle or like a triangle and you are going to buy such phone and believe it is trendy?<br><br>Besides that, should I masturbate when I see retracting part of the phone? Is this really so futuristic? It is extra mechanical part. This means it can break, especially when it is a Chinese stuff.<br><br>I want to have buttons, not gestures. Gestures are not intuitive, buttons are. Windows 8 was a failure because it didn&#39;t have start button but it had hidden stuff, for example when you moved mouse to the edge something was happening but nothing in the UI suggested it so it was counterintuitive. How one should figure out all the gestures when there is nothing in the UI that lets you to figure them out? This makes simple things complicated and counterintuitive.<br><br>This screen to body ratio feature is overadvertised because it is not constant. For example it changes when you want to take pictures and the phone is larger when you take pictures. For me it is more important to have non-chinese phone with sharp screen corners and minimum mechanical parts than huge screen to body ratio. Low screen to body ratio will not break. Electric engine can break. Lower screen to body ratio will not loose pixels, curverd corners loose pixels.",0

Ugw0hXPaiKhOdWUlY4V4AaABAg,@incorrectname9294,Yes... but i think i prefer the like iPhone x notch and especially the gestures. And the camera is a lot better on any smartphone if its there already. Who wants to spend like an extra 10 second trying to get the camera out and loaded and then take a photo of a life changing event which is now a normal photo because u missed it. Gestures are more natural on the X and why do you need such a edge  to edge display? I mean a normal display on like an iPhone 6 or a standard smartphone or like a pixel is nice. Even a Samsung edge to edge thing still with the camera is okay.,0

UgzbPdCePIwYkyDUyAR4AaABAg,@BrokeWillSmith,"The design looks gorgeous! Cool trick camera. Not impressed with the gesture back button. I&#39;d prefer standard or capacitive buttons. As cool as it is, the design can&#39;t possibly be IP68 resistant to water and dust with that moving camera section. That&#39;s kind of expected now. Speaking of moving parts, mechanical moving parts means wear, Wear = premature failure. This phone will be prone to fail.  Can you keep the camera section out to save battery life? Moving mass requires power, hence the large 3730mAh battery. One benefit of the trick camera is that it likely won&#39;t be covered in greasy fingerprints since it will usually be hidden, giving you clearer pictures. The unique design is exciting but how comfortable will it be to use everyday?",0

UgxAvAkOXRp6xO3cAkl4AaABAg,@ImDultra,"I’ll give my thought on this phone, Who am I right? Anyways, I have recently purchased the iPhone X, I can say looking at this phone I am jealous, only to a certain point though, firstly the screen looks amazing, the slide up camera sensor and light though, Waterproofing, I don’t see it, How will it handle cases? Not seeing it, what if the mechanism that brings up the camera malfunctions( water spill soda spill drop on the actual thing, or if it stops working all togethor, seems unreplaceable) The screen too, AMAZING, buuttt, cracked screen replacement would be preferred to be done by a professional since it’s an all glass screen, you don’t want it break while installing, really hard to do on your own. The back in love with no bad notes on that one, camera looks pristine even though I would never use it, Good Phone but the MAIN attraction is also the biggest flaw, Reason why the big companies didn’t go with the slide up accessories. Hard to manage keep working in a good manner and replacement issues, Amazing phone nonetheless, Would be interested if it was made from a solid company ie. Apple Samsung. Running IOS 10 looked beautiful too, THIS IS A PAID VIDEO BY THE COMPANY don’t forget that, so we don’t know the things he didn’t like the flaws and glitches that were edited out, Amazing Phone, But not a trustworthy one In my eyes, Why work with a stranger down the street when your best bud who you know has expertise in the field can be right there......Just saying Good Day",0

But if you had a case that was snug the camera wouldn&#39;t be able to pop up and if the case did have space you would have an awkward notch and your phone could just slip out of the case. Somebody would have to make a case that would connect to the phone somehow (aux or bluetooth) that would send the case a sign to let the case slide up and make the extra space for the camera to pop up. Then close when done.,0

You can then use the main camera to take selfies with using the screen to get a rough idea of the picture.The small LCD screen could also be used to provide a soft white light when taking selfies so you don&#39;t get just the harsh flash. You could also turn the small screen into the fingerprint sensor as well.,0

I mean it should not be included there, the idea was to remove that front cam from the display area coz they wanted a bezel-less display. I mean there is no display at the back of the phone so the rear cam should not be in that popping out part<br><br>- So they ve already removed the headphone jack and touch id sensor and putting face id alone instead. Sounds familiar? Now you hate oppo too for doing that<br><br>- That gesture in multi tasking is similar to... hmmm! Hehe!<br>- I think the future is when the front cam is already a virtual camera, removing the physical one. The future of phone is not yet here, our technology now is not yet ready <br><br>- the only thing i like was the quality of photo or the image.<br><br>But these are just my opinions I dont know yours.

Ugwpb3gwbJVXyOvLgWR4AaABAg,@relentlesswriter,Can we just agree there are certain cons for it? Like how long it last like everything has it&#39;s limit right so how long will it come out and go back in? What about what resistance? Will it not make it come out slow if it gets spoiled? What if someone activates the cam on the lock screen and inside your pocket it&#39;s switched on and the thing is trying to come out but can&#39;t because you&#39;re riding or sitting in a tight jeans? Like there are many more things i can surely think of but also the main question is how strong that part is like when you&#39;re taking a selfie or shooting something and it falls on the part with the phone&#39;s weight at it&#39;s back so what will happen... will it bend or not.... damn future is worrying the shit out of at the moment.... but waiting for the full review video! ✌,0

Something is going to get jammed or broken. Where are you taking it to get fixed then? The Oppo store? Anxious to see the real world tests all the other phones get subjected to when the production models come out.,0

That forehead popping up every time you need to unlock is so dissatisfying, and what if you drop the phone with that out? Is the lighting sensor also there? If yes, how is the phone gonna change brightness in real time? You also need to mind how you will hold the device in order to not put too much pressure and force that moving part back in, and if it breaks, you won’t be able to use any camera, so no facial recognition, no photos, no flashlight. I’m not sure about that, but people are saying it also won’t be water resistant. There are just too many drawbacks in order to get this bezelless look, it’s not worth it, just do like Samsung or Apple, those small bezels on top/bottom or the notch are no big deal",0

Ugy2v3fFNEC3laiDibl4AaABAg,@abeeeed7541,The mechanical part of the camera is not a good thing to have just because if you break the phone and that thing is damaged it will cost so much to fix and it is not a good thing to have a movable part on a phone just because the structure will become fragile and that leads to more money that you have to put down if you drop it. Samsung’s and iPhones are not to expensive to fix just because they don’t have movable parts that makes the structure weak but then there are some phones out there with movable parts just like this and the cost so much to fix.,0

In the case of Nex, it&#39;s OK, as most of the people don&#39;t use the front camera a lot.... So, even if someone take 50 selfies a day (lol), it can last for about 3 years.... <br>But... in the case of Find X, the pop-up thing comes up everytime you unlock the phone and when you open the camera app... You&#39;ll unlock your phone atleast 50 times a day.... And... the rear camera also.... almost everyone will use it a lot.. So...

Your skin tone in the picture is quite off if compared to your natural one. The picture looks more reddish than in real life while also the mannequin wasn’t spot on. Color calibration must be much closer to real life colours. This, in my opinion is very important since phones now are substituting cameras more and more. But as you said, this is just a very early edition, a sort of prototype so, not final version. With such promising product, I hope the final version will improve more, especially when it comes to the photographic/color section/s.",0

Across all the popular manufacturers, they have similar design though granted they also have unique characteristics. But face it, either it&#39;s Samsung or Apple or any other manufacturers, they have the same footprint. Through the years they compete and we&#39;ve seen new and amazing tech applied on phones, fingerprint sensors and face recognition to name a few. But the overall phone design has became very boring in my opinion in the sense that it&#39;s a brick with a couple of buttons and a camera. <br><br>Oppo and Vivo saw a chance to apply and send out new things to the public because they&#39;re probably as bored as me with the big players in the field fiddling wíth camera quality and bigger capacity for storage and RAM.

So making a case for this device shouldn&#39;t be a problem. The case could just have another cutout at that point.<br>Of course the Vivo NEX only has the front camera in the sled and not all those face recognition sensors. But the iPhone X shows that those sensors don&#39;t have to span the whole width of the device. Otherwise the notch would be as wide as the device and wouldn&#39;t be a notch anymore.,0

I&#39;d like to see what they do in terms of a secure workaround (that can&#39;t be exploited). Maybe it&#39;s a bit early to call it innovative, but I will say that it&#39;s an interesting concept.

Ugw0cvs6vHCBGByKWOp4AaABAg,@CalebWrightfunkofilming,I will say that pop up camera is pretty nice. However personally I dont think the phone is innovative that much being that 95% of the described features are just enchanced versions of existing phone features on the market. Inovation would show us something we haven&#39;t even seen. Such as a camera thwt can take actual pictures of the stars or being able to holograhpically scan an item and determine its mathematics values via mass volume and other statistics. But these arent &quot;mainstream&quot; things so therefore innovation is quite limited currently,0

Without a case this phone is doomed to break, gorilla glass is really strong but not indestructible and i&#39;d be more worried about breaking the camera section more then anything, guessing it won&#39;t tolerate much of a drop while the camera is out. don&#39;t really care for gesture based controls and without looking it up i&#39;m guessing this phone will suffer similar problems to the other long screen devices and that will be black borders on the sides during video playback.

I mean yeah it looks awesome but compared to phones with a little more bezels and actual buttons it is slower gesture based phones waste time and a phone is supposed to be a convenience device so every time they keep adding &quot;new features&quot; that make the experience slower and not as convenient as it was prior. I just really don&#39;t understand why people love the way the industry is going. Take the iphone 8 plus, people think the bezels are big and the phone &quot;looks outdated&quot; sure whatever but it is very functional, has a 1080p display which if fine in a screen 5.5 inches you don&#39;t 1440p or higher that is just ridiculous I mean a 640p ipod touch has double the pixel density of a 27 inch 4k monitor and no one thinks they look bad, and possible the best thing about the iphone 8 is the physical home button(yet static) it is physical feeling to the touch and you can be pulling your phone out of your pocket and have it unlocked well before you even get it to your face these &quot;face unlock&quot; phones are gimmicky and slower than finger print scanners and even if they say the face unlock is more secure than fingerprint scanners I dont get it what is everyone having a fucking kgb agent trying to take your phone and unlock I have never had anyone try to unlock my phone what kind of ghetto do people live in where this is an issue? do you just leave your phone on the street and have random people come up and try to unlock your phone?

But stop and think about it, is it really copying? Rather than copy, I would say it’s more like borrowing, one borrows another’s technology in order to improve. If you really want to call that a “copy”, then I would say all phones nowadays “copies” Nokia, but that’s not really the case.

I have a Note 4, watching this video made Oppo Find X on top of my list as my next smartphone. I have several wishes for this phone though since it is still on its engineering stage:  huge battery (graphene-based please), 4k display (because there&#39;s the option to lower it to 1080p anyway),  still noticed a tiny chin, make the edges uniform please, on-screen fingerprint scan (back placement would be fine but give us this option please because the market is still nervous having our face scanned), camera with high DxOMark and AI-supported, and almost vanilla Android version P UI on release.  I guarantee you Oppo, make this happen and you will be singing your way to the bank and deservingly grab the third seat in the smartphone competition (get off your butt LG and HTC!

I would assume that most of the people who buy this $2000 phone are going to want it to last. Without the protection (although minimal) that the bezels provide, this appears like it wont hold to terribly well with the inevitable drops. In addition to this, the moving top means that the protective case will have a big fat divide to allow protection, which won&#39;t do any favors for thee structural integrity. It definitely seems cool, but I don&#39;t suspect that it will last very long.<br><br>** Edit<br>The lambo edition is $2000 (1699 euros) and the price is of the other versions is about $1150 (£999)",26

UgxigEl0mQh-KU5ufBp4AaABAg,@Chawrinpravinth,Oppo Vivo And OnePlus all manufactured by the same master company BBK. They introduced 90%+ screen is to body ratio in the Vivo Apex which was a prototype. And recently they released that as a consumer phone with a 91% screen is to body ratio as Vivo Nex. Now they are introducing The Oppo Find X with a amaizing 93% of screen is to body ratio. There is no doubt that BBK has more tech than this.  Eventhough the camera is good we request a speed comparison and Graphics comparison with the Vivo Nex against the price variation of the other phones of the market. Thank You!,0

They set a bar again for everyone! Again the only problem with apple is the price! They made phones a little more affordable then there&#39;s really nothing better than an iPhone! Everyone knows how secure is iPhone, and how fast it is and how good is the camera but the price makes it so unaffordable that somewhere the goodness is not seen!

I want to show others that it&#39;s all about positivity and energy.. and that with the right mindset, you can overcome any mental or physical hurdle if u just learn to love yourself! positive energy trumps any physical shell! go check me out and subscribe if u want to help me reach my goal of helping others who lack self-love.. it would mean the world to me!!",13
